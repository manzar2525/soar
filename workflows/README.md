# Playbook Workflow Repository

This repository contains workflows for popular security playbooks. It provides a comprehensive guide to implementing these playbooks, including manual and automated steps, and visual representations of the workflows using flowcharts.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

* **Document** common security playbooks in a clear and consistent format.
* **Provide step-by-step instructions** for implementing playbooks, catering to both manual and automated approaches.
* **Visualize** playbook workflows using flowcharts for easy understanding.
* **Serve as a resource** for security professionals to improve their incident response and security operations.

## Structure

The repository is organized by playbook category and individual playbook. Each playbook has its own directory containing the following:

* **`README.md`**: A detailed description of the playbook, including its purpose, scope, and key steps.
* **`manual_steps.md`**: A list of manual procedures to be performed as part of the playbook.
* **`automated_steps.md`**: Guidance on how to automate parts or all of the playbook, including potential tools and scripts.
* **`workflow.md`**: The Mermaid code for the flowchart visualizing the playbook workflow.

## Content

The repository includes workflows for various security playbooks, such as:

* **Phishing Incident Response:**
    * [Phishing Workflow Diagram](workflows/Phishing/readme.md)
    * [Phishing Workflow Mermaid Code](workflows/Phishing/workflow.md)
* **Malware Analysis**
* **Data Breach Response**
* **Vulnerability Management**
* **Insider Threat Detection**
* And more...

## Workflow Representation

Playbook workflows are represented using Mermaid flowcharts. This allows for clear and concise visualization of the steps involved in each playbook.

**Example: Phishing Incident Response Workflow**

The flowchart illustrates the following stages:

1.  **Phishing Report Received**
2.  **Automated Triage**
3.  **Initial Automated Analysis** (Email Metadata, Content, URLs, Attachments)
4.  **Risk Scoring**
5.  **Low Risk Path** (Update Blocklists, Close Alert)
6.  **Medium/High Risk Path** (Analyst Review, Manual Email Review, Update Classification)
7.  **False Positive Handling** (Document, Tune Rules, Close Alert)
8.  **Confirmed Phishing Response** (Determine Attack Type, Document IOCs, Assess Severity & Impact)
9.  **Containment Actions** (Quarantine Email, Block URLs, Block Sender, Add IOCs)
10. **Exposure Analysis** (Identify Recipients, Check Logs, Query Proxy Logs)
11. **User Interaction Handling** (Document No Exposure, Identify Affected Users, Check for Credential Input, Hunt for Post-Compromise IOCs, Determine Compromise Scope)
12. **Compromise Handling** (Document Limited Exposure, Initiate Incident Response, Reset User Credentials, Isolate Endpoints, Perform Forensic Analysis, Check for Lateral Movement, Remediate)
13. **User Notification** (Create Template, Send Notifications, Determine if Org-Wide Alert Needed, Track Acknowledgments)
14. **Documentation and Reporting** (Create Incident Report, Record Actions, Document Lessons Learned, Update Phishing Database, Share IOCs)
15. **Intelligence Updates** (Update Detection Rules, Enhance Controls, Update Training, Calculate Metrics, Close Incident)
